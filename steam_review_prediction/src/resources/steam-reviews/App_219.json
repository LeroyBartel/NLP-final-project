So that is personally why I chose to play the Demo of Half Life 2, I has a strange simularity to the Counter Strike series. There are buildings to climb, places to hide, weapons to shoot and explosive weapons and props.\nSo I am a bit 50-50 with this game I only got the Demo for a taster of the real game, and trust me, level 6 is scary!",

"review": "Ah, Half Life 2, it's a great game. but why buy this if you already own GMod. They put in all the weapons, Health and Ammo GUIs and characters. So that is personally why I chose to play the Demo of Half Life 2, I has a strange simularity to the Counter Strike series. There are buildings to climb, places to hide, weapons to shoot and explosive weapons and props.\nSo I am a bit 50-50 with this game I only got the Demo for a taster of the real game, and trust me, level 6 is scary!",
